# Face-Detection
CNNs detect and extract hierarchical facial features through convolutional and pooling layers, transforming images into embeddings. These embeddings enable identity matching via similarity metrics. Architectures like FaceNet (embedding-based) and DeepFace (deep CNN) excel in accuracy.
